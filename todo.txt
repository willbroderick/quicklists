Next steps...

- concurrency, locally store last-updated timestamp (on list), & check last-updated timestamp matches on post.
-- Prompt for reload if out of synch, but don't force (keep red outline on list).

- Masonry rearranging for lists? Find a plugin, or use something other than masonry? Rearranging DOM elements doesn't seem to work reliably.

- new ui for reordering & deleting
[list item (link)][bar | del]
--add markup for internal (links) & external (remove/reorder) controls
